# 'Hope for Tomorrow'

# A hopeful song to inspire a brighter future

# Verse 1

Ready to start a brand new day, no more bad surprise
Though I'm feeling so uneasy, I open my eyes wide
And I'm strong and faithful, hoping for tomorrow to arrive"

# Chorus

chorus = "Cause I hope for tomorrow, when the night is gone
I'll be closer to my dreams, so I can carry on
The future's waiting for me, I will take it on
Cause I'm longing for the light, hope for tomorrow"

# Verse 2

lyrics_2 = "There are days full of sunshine yet others veiled in rain
And some that quietly pass by on an endless train
But I'm not ready to give up, I'm searching for the flame
To keep me going, light my way, hope for tomorrow's name"

# Bridge

bridge = "There's no time for reflecting, just focus on what's right
I'll keep moving forward, no given night or light
I want to live for the moment and feel the joy inside
Open up to the world and find what will be mine"

# Final Chorus

I'll be closer to my dreams, so I can carry on
The future's waiting for me, I will take it on
Cause I'm longing for the light, hope for tomorrow"
